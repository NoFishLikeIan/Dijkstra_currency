# Dijkstra_currency
Some fun implementations of djkstra in python for currency trading.

All started with a blog post by [Eric Jang](http://evjang.com/) about the various fields in which path finding algorithms arise ([great read](https://blog.evjang.com/2018/08/dijkstras.html)). Just thought I would try something then!

### Static_djk.py

First really simple path finding with static rates. Lunch it with
```
$ python static_djk.py
```
Type the two currencies you need to exchange and get the shortest path.
